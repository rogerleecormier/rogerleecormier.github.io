# 🔗 ERP & SaaS Integration

My portfolio includes hands-on leadership of ERP and financial SaaS ecosystems—designing, integrating, and governing the flow of data between core systems like NetSuite, Ramp, Vena, Checkbook.io, Box, and Smartsheet.

As a NetSuite administrator and cross-platform integrator, I specialize in building **secure, low-friction workflows** across teams, tools, and APIs.
