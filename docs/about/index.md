I’m Roger Cormier—a Technical Project Manager and U.S. Army veteran who operates at the intersection of cloud platforms, SaaS ecosystems, and operational strategy. I specialize in modernizing legacy systems, integrating enterprise tools, and aligning cross-functional teams around systems thinking and practical execution.

With experience spanning DevOps, ERP, and SaaS environments, I lead delivery initiatives that eliminate manual friction, surface actionable insight, and support scalable, audit-ready outcomes. I thrive in fast-changing environments, quickly mastering unfamiliar platforms, APIs, and enterprise tools to deliver immediate value.

## 🪖 Military Background

Before entering the private sector, I served as a Non-Commissioned Officer (NCO) in the U.S. Army, leading signal communications teams responsible for secure, mission-critical infrastructure across global operations. My roles included managing RF and satellite transmission systems, overseeing WIN-T tactical networks, and operating 24/7 Network Operations Centers (NOCs) in high-stakes environments.

This experience instilled a leadership style rooted in discipline, clarity, and ownership—under pressure and at scale. It continues to inform how I lead cross-functional technical teams, navigate complexity, and drive delivery with operational rigor.

## ✝️ Values & Personal Ethic

I'm a Christian, a husband, and a father of five—and those commitments shape how I lead. I approach work with a sense of stewardship, integrity, and service.

I don’t bring religion into the workplace, but I do lead with consistency, humility, and the belief that leadership is about responsibility to others—not authority over them.

## 🧠 Leadership Philosophy

| Principle             | Behavior in Practice                              |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Systems over silos    | I design for integration and sustainability, not isolation |
| Clarity is non-negotiable | I surface ambiguity early and align teams around shared understanding |
| Respect as a standard | I challenge ideas, not people—and I lead by example |
| Calm under pressure   | I bring structure, not panic, when uncertainty hits |
| Outcomes over activity| I define success by delivery, adoption, and durability—not just effort |
