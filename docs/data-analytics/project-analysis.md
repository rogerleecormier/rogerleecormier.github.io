# 📊 Project Risk Analysis – Budget Insights

## 🧾 Project Overview

This project analyzes a dataset of 4,000 real-world project records to explore how budget correlates with risk level and complexity. The goal is to surface patterns in budget allocation across projects and visualize how often projects fall into specific budget tiers.

**Data Source**: [Kaggle – Project Management Risk Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ka66ledata/project-management-risk-raw)

## 🧠 Observations

- The dataset is **right-skewed**, with most project budgets falling below $1.5M.
- High frequency is observed in the $650K – $1.15M budget range.
- Very few projects exceed $2.5M in budget, suggesting large projects are rare.
- This budget distribution can inform project scoping, resource allocation, and portfolio-level financial planning.
